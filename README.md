## Welcome to my (in progress) textbook on linear algebra!

I'm keeping this repo on GitHub to keep track of my own progress and help me get to the finish line, as well as to allow people who are curious or wish to keep track of my progress to comment and guide me through this writing. 

I welcome all feedback! Email me at [dt372 at cornell dot edu] if you'd like to comment on what's here so far.

Again, this is a work in progress, so not all parts of the book are completed - below is a list of all completed parts of this book.

* Table of Contents (without subsections)
* First Chapter (draft)
